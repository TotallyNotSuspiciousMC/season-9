# Totally Not Suspicious Season Custom and Resource Packs

This repo contains three custom datapacks and one resource pack:

* **Season Data**: Basic data changes such as recipes, loot tables, and advancements.
* **Season Worldgen**: Changes to world generation such as new dimensions.
* **Swampier Swamps**: Specific worldgen changes for swamps.
* **Season Resource Pack**: Custom item textures and models.

# Lantern Load

This uses [Lantern Load](https://github.com/LanternMC/Load). This project uses the pack names `tns`, `tns.wg`, and `swamp` for the `load.status` objective.
